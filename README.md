# JavaShapeClassChecker

The driver class reads the shape names from the shape.txt file and then classifies them into the shapes accordingly.

Currently it has only two sub classes or two shapes to compare it the data from the .txt file.

The individual shape class takes in the variables, such as radius or length/width of the shape and then returns perimeter, area and name of the shape the back to the driver class.

Lastly, the driver class prints it back onto the running console log.
